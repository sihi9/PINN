This is a simple example to demonstrate how to include physics into Machine Learning. It was created as part of the lecture "Computational Intelligence Seminar B" at TU Graz.

## Installation
Just install all required packages with pip.

## Usage
- Run *data_generator.py* to generate you data samples. All files should be stored in the same working directory
- Run the *example.ipynb* to see the use of PINN. Feel free to play around with model architectures, hyperparameters, and different ways of including physics
